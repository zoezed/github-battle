React GitHub battle 

This  is part of the React Fundamentals (TylerMcGinnis) course. Github battle takes two GitHub users and battles them. 
Popular repos are also listed.
This application is built following along with the stages of the course. 
Note that it does not use ES6 techniques as this is refactored at a later stage.
